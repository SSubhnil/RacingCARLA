# CARLA-Racing
A program for a self-driving car to learn to drive faster on a racetrack. The 3D environment is CARLA, an open soource autonomous driving simulator. We use vehicle sensors like, for example, RGB camera, RADAR, LIDAR, IMU, etc. for accurate state estimation and, for the time being, Learning Model Predictive Controller (LMPC) that decides the control inputs and possible futue states.
